      <p>The Unit for Future Skills is an analytical and research unit within the Department for Education. It has been set up to improve the quality of jobs and skills data, working across government to make this available and more accessible to policy makers, stakeholders and the general public.</p>

      <p>This data and research will support a better understanding of current skill mismatches and future demand throughout the country. It will help our skills system respond effectively to deliver good jobs and higher productivity.</p>

      <h2 id="role">Role</h2>

      <p>Working closely with analysts and data experts across government departments, together with a wide range of external stakeholders, the unit will:​</p>

      <ul>
        <li>build up the data infrastructure to create new links between datasets to identify how skills are used in the economy</li>
        <li>conduct analysis and present data in new ways to address data gaps and improve our evidence-base</li>
        <li>become a centre of expertise on future skills, developing robust methodology and insights on current and future skills needs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Unit for Future Skills builds on the analysis and research of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/skills-and-productivity-board" class="govuk-link">Skills and Productivity Board</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="data">Data</h2>

      <p>The unit has supported the development of new data on the type of employment people undertake after training. You can access the data through our dashboards.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>maximise the impact of existing research and insights by building a research network that includes:
          <ul>
            <li>government departments</li>
            <li>think-tanks</li>

      <p>The unit is developing a longer-term workplan to improve data and identify insights on skills and jobs through existing and new research. Core to this will be continuing to work with other government departments to bring together different datasets and make these widely available, including through <abbr title="application programming interfaces">APIs</abbr> (application programming interfaces).</p>

      <p>Priorities for 2022 include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>an improved careers pathways dashboard, providing more detail on which qualifications support employment within a local area</li>
        <li>a skills demand dashboard showing what types of jobs are being advertised within a locality</li>
        <li>conducting research projects on future skills demand forecasting and a UK specific skills taxonomy</li>
        <li>gathering feedback from users to help shape the Unit’s products and longer-term priorities</li>
